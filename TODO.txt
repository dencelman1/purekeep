    1 utf32;
    2 array that supports digits with (32, 64) bytes;

[ now ]:

1 string have (length field) and for lengths we create a separated file;

2 uint: [] length (8, 16, 32, 64 bits), and which code value have each char (8, 16, 32 bits);

3 than whan we compare strings, we indicate comparison of (
    3.1 length
    ||
    3.2 string value
);
