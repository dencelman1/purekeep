- has and isin for float and integer without conversion to string;

- NEW_TYPES () {
    1 utf32;
    2 array that supports digits with (32, 64) bytes;
};


[ now ]:

task STRING {
    1 string have (length field) and for lengths we create a separated file;

    2 uint: [] length (8, 16, 32, 64 bits), and which code value have each char (8, 16, 32 bits);

    3 than whan we compare strings, we indicate comparison of (
        3.1 length
        ||
        3.2 string value
    );
};


[ Based on array length ( with fixed limit ) ( prepared Buffers in array ) ]:
1 create;

2 read;

[ With limit or those, which falls under the terms of the request ]:
3 update;
4 delete;

5 after every CRUD operation ( save changes in static memory ( config ) );

6 inner mutex (ask fastify about it);
